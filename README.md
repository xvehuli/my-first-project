# Neutron Transport Monte Carlo Simulation
## 🚀 Project Overview
A MATLAB-based Monte Carlo simulation to study the penetration probability of neutrons through different shielding materials (Lead, Water, Concrete).
## ✨ Features
- **Physics Modeling**: Simulates neutron absorption and isotropic scattering.
- **Multi-Material Support**: Pre-configured properties for Pb, H₂O, and Concrete.
- **Visualization**: Real-time trajectory plotting and probability curve generation.
